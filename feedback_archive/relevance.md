##~~Don't show discontinued products at top of results~~

>Additionally, is there a reason for the high percentage of search results featuring discontinued products? It seems kind of frustrating if someone's looking for their perfect product and finds out most of them are no longer available. Could they be moved lower on the list so they're not so prominent? It might be kind of disheartening otherwise. My search for sunscreens lacking alcohol and avobenzone turned up a ton of discontinued results, and I kind of want to go cry in a hole somewhere.

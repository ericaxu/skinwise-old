##More filter types
####Filter by country
Christina says:
>Are you planning on sticking with just American products? If not, you might consider allowing users to filter by country/continent. For example, I'm mostly interested in Japanese sunscreens because the formulas tend to be more cosmetically elegant. This feature combined with the "filter out" option would allow me to find Japanese (or Asian, if you don't want to implement such specific filters) sunscreens that lack both alcohol and avobenzone. Non-Western skincare has gotten pretty popular in recent years, and it might be a good thing to cover in order to appeal to true skincare addicts.

####Filter by SPF/PPD (Sunscreen property)
Christina says:
>Speaking of sunscreen, could you add SPF and PA/PPD ratings to the filter list? I don't use anything under SPF 50 and am careful to use at least PA+++ sunscreen on a daily basis, so the current search model is limiting for someone like me (I burn easily and then get weird patches of hyperpigmentation if I'm not incredibly vigilant regarding sun care).

##~~Numbers in Filter Labels~~
Elena says:
>However, it might be useful to show how many products are in each category/brand in parenthesis (is this possible)?

##~~Negative Filter~~
Marie says:
>I'm sure this is in the works, but one feature I'd recommend is the ability to cull results with negative filters from searches (ie, No Cetaphil or No Rose Oil). It would be super continent for people with ingredient sensitivities. Another thing, though more complicated, might be to filter by country availability.

Christina says:
>One thing I noticed when using filters is that you can only filter by something you want to search for. For example an ingredient filter would be niacinamide. But if I specifically wanted to avoid products containing niacinamide because they didn't work for me in the past, it would be helpful to have an option to filter them out. Same goes for specified brands and products.

Elena says:
>Also, the ability to filter "out" an ingredient (that is, show all except a certain ingredient) would be useful.

			"description": "To fully appreciate this professional-grade scrub, a brief skincare lesson is in order. Let\u2019s start with enzymes: These potent molecules actually dissolve the bonds that hold dead skin cells together. Next up are microderm crystals: ultrafine minerals that buff away tired skin. Vasanti\u2019s multi-action exfoliator features both these skincare wonders, plus healing natural ingredients to get the jump on irritation. The result? Renewed, refreshed skin without any redness.<br>This powerful exfoliator mimics the results of professional microdermabrasion, minus the potential for redness and sensitivity. First, papaya enzymes break down dead cells while evening out your skin tone. Next, dermatologist-approved microderm crystals fade the appearance of fine lines and acne scars, leaving skin smooth and free of imperfections. Finally, aloe vera, coconut, and vitamins B and E nourish fresh skin to keep it free of irritation.<br>Three to five times a week, wet your face and massage a pea-sized amount of product into skin, concentrating on trouble zones. Rinse away. Used consistently, a single tube will last you four to six months.",
